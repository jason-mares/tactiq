  - In a world that can feel relentless and unforgiving, love presents itself as a light in the darkness. However, we often struggle with how to love as imperfect beings. This community's mission is to offer meaning, beauty, and guidance through life's struggles using the gospel of Jesus Christ as a blueprint to build bridges to an ever-loving and forgiving God in our lives and communities. <br><br><a href="#projectbackground" class="scrollLink">Learn more about this project.</a>

According to long-term data, every major religious denomination in America has been on the decline since WWII.<a href="https://youtu.be/3xlb-2DEYW8?t=284" target="_blank"><sup>[1]</sup></a> In 2018, it's estimated only 4% of Millenials were active in a church while an older, more dedicated generation becomes smaller everyday. America—having historically relied on churches as a crucial social safety net—has seen rises in homelessness, substance abuse and widening political divisions as the social fabric a church can provide continues to erode. This has left a vacuum in American communities and with no new institutions taking its place in significant enough numbers, the lack of social cohesion threatens to rip apart communities nationwide.

At the same time, Americans are becoming increasingly skeptical of a certain brand of institutionalized Christianity that can seem more interested in policing morals than creating a compelling response to an epidemic of loneliness & despair that is pervasive in modern American culture.<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/america-is-losing-ground-to-death-and-despair/2018/11/30/77c6b38e-f45a-11e8-bc79-68604ed88993_story.html?utm_term=.2bdeefc30aff" target="_blank"><sup>[2]</sup></a> While there have been earnest attempts by many forward thinking congregations to address contemporary issues, younger generations simply aren't engaged in ways inspiring action.<a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/christian-chiakulas/churches-millennials-if-they-just-did-this_b_8215846.html" target="_blank"><sup>[3]</sup></a>

America is indeed caught in a spiritual crisis as much as a social & economic crisis at the dawn of this century.

Under the leadership of pastor Mark Lohman, The Bridge recognized a need to modernize and integrate a hopeful Christian mission deep into the communities it serves so they may engage these issues head on. The aim of the project was to establish a new logo and visual style guide that would showcase the beauty of the local community and emphasize the importance of human connection.
