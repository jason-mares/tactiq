However, we often struggle with how to love as imperfect beings. This community's mission is to offer meaning, beauty, and guidance through life's struggles using the gospel of Jesus Christ as a blueprint to build bridges to an ever-loving and forgiving God in our lives and communities. | class

The Bridge, a Christian community organization, recognized the need to adapt to the changing social landscape and integrate their mission in a modern, compelling way. With long-term data showing a decline in religious denominations and a rise in social issues such as homelessness and substance abuse, The Bridge aimed to establish a new identity and brand that would resonate with younger generations and emphasize the importance of human connection.

Under the leadership of Pastor Mark Lohman, the project began with the development of a new logo and visual style guide that showcased the beauty of local communities and inspired action to address contemporary issues. To introduce the tone and feel of the new brand, a trailer was created to make stakeholders feel the gravity of what was possible with the rebrand.

The new brand serves as a beacon of hope, emphasizing the importance of community and connection in the face of social and economic challenges. By embracing a modern, inclusive message, The Bridge is able to reach a wider audience and make a meaningful impact in the lives of those they serve.

Through a thoughtful approach to identity design and branding, The Bridge sought to provide a sense of social cohesion and spiritual guidance in a time of crisis. The new brand reflects the organization's commitment to engaging contemporary issues and addressing the needs of the community. By working to establish a strong, compelling identity, The Bridge is able to inspire action and build a brighter future for all.
