Supreme Suspensions, a leading lift kit and accessories manufacturer, was facing several challenges with their flagship brand. The existing WordPress shop was outdated, resulting in a decline in revenue. Moreover, the lack of a defined style guide led to brand confusion, as the designers followed different styles. In order to address these issues, four key solutions were implemented.

Firstly, a style guide was created to ensure that the team was aligned with the goal of increasing the effectiveness of ad and marketing campaigns. Secondly, a mobile-first website was redesigned, with a target conversion rate of 2%. Thirdly, the page load times were reduced to less than 0.02 seconds. Finally, a logical navigation system was developed to improve the overall user experience.

As a result of these efforts, Supreme Suspensions achieved remarkable success. The new website design and improved page load times led to a significant increase in conversion rates. The implementation of the style guide helped to establish a consistent brand identity, reducing confusion among customers. The logical navigation system provided an enhanced user experience, leading to a surge in positive customer feedback. The collaboration between Supreme Suspensions and the team responsible for the solutions resulted in a successful case study that serves as a testament to the importance of strategic planning and execution.
