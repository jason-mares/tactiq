With the establishment of Skytech Pro, Skytech Gaming aimed to broaden their reach and cater to the needs of creative professionals, government agencies, and business clients. My task was to help them establish a unique and recognizable brand identity that would effectively communicate their values and expertise to their target audience.

Through collaboration with the Skytech team, I developed a comprehensive branding strategy that highlighted the company's commitment to innovation, reliability, and customer support. This strategy was executed through a range of design elements, including a new logo, color scheme, typography, and visual style.

The result was a cohesive and memorable brand identity that effectively conveyed Skytech Pro's strengths and values. The new branding helped the company establish a strong presence in their target markets, enabling them to successfully expand their reach and serve a broader audience. The Skytech Pro brand is now powering the likes of architectural firms, MIT academics and cutting edge AI research.
