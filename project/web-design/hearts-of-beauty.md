Hearts of Beauty is an organization dedicated to providing women with a chance to recharge and heal their emotional, mental, and spiritual wounds at a biannual weekend retreat. However, the day-to-day management system that was supposed to bring healing and restoration was causing undue stress and frustration for the volunteers who manage it. The outdated and manual payment and registration process required volunteers to spend hours calling registered guests to collect outstanding balances and manually tracking responses on a spreadsheet. The irony of the situation was not lost on the Hearts of Beauty team - the very retreat designed to help people was driving its volunteers crazy.

UX research was conducted to identify pain points and understand user needs. The new system was designed with the goal of streamlining the registration process and providing valuable data for future planning. Insights gathered from the UX research phase aided in the creation of a new website with a user-friendly interface and intuitive registration system.

The updated system was launched just in time for the Fall 2022 retreat, and the results were significant. Volunteer hours spent on registration management dropped by 90%, freeing up time for volunteers to focus on other aspects of the retreat. Guests were also pleased with the simplified process, leading to a better overall experience.

Through UX design and research, the Hearts of Beauty retreat was able to provide a better experience for both volunteers and guests, while also increasing efficiency and saving valuable time.

Improvements to user registration includes:
- Email notifications are sent automatically to remind users of upcoming payments.
- The payment plans offered are on a month-to-month basis.
- The organization has saved thousands of dollars in transaction fees after reducing payment processing fees from 3.49% to 1%.
- Volunteers can manage all registered users using a single dashboard.
- Coupon codes can be created and offered to users.
- Registration data can be exported to an Excel file for check-in purposes.
