During its growth, Supreme Suspensions commissioned two 24x36‚Äù posters: one as an internal inspirational poster and the other to promote their sponsored race truck driver, Wade Wyman. The internal poster, called the Russian Propaganda piece, borrowed traditional USSR propaganda imagery and subverted it. The Wade Wyman poster was inspired by the cool style of a Quintin Tarantino movie.

Originally intended for internal use only, both posters became promotional giveaways at race events and have since found homes on the walls of countless garages, shops, and bedrooms across the United States.
